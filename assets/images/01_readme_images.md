IMAGES directory structure

@package LibreHealthEHR

The /images/ directory contains 3rd party sourced images,
and only image files and sub-directories with image packages
that are contiguous,but are not merely associated assets 
that can be organized into the existing directory structure. 
Subdirectory content is subject to approval by the project.
Native LibreHealth EHR image mimetype content is organized under the /libraries/
directory.

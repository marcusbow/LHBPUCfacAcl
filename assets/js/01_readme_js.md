JS include directory structure

@package LibreHealthEHR

The /js/ directory contains minimized javascript libraries
and sub-directories with other javascript resource packages
that are contiguous, but are not merely associated fonts, 
et cetera that exist elsewhere.  Framework level subdirectories
such as Bootstrap that are javascript related (minimized to
 components actually used) go here.
Subdirectory content is subject to approval by the project.

**Welcome to LibreEHR!!!**

LibeEHR is a Free and Open Source electronic health records and
medical practice management application. 

The mission of LibreHealth.io is to help provide high quality medical care to all people, regardless socioeconomic status or geographic location, by giving medical practices and clinics across the globe access to medical software, free of charge.

That same software is designed to save clinics both time and money, which gives practitioners more time to spend with individual patients, thereby affording patients with higher quality care.

We are current and former contributors to OpenEMR and thank that community for years of hard work. We intend to honor that legacy by allowing this new community to leverage the good things in OpenEMR, share what we create and not be afraid to break backward compatibility in the name of forward progress and modern development models.

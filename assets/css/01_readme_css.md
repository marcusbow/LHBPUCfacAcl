CSS directory structure

@package LibreHealthEHR

The /css/ directory contains css, and only css
and sub-directories with css packages that are contiguous,
but are not merely associated assets that can be organized
into the existing directory structure. 
Subdirectory content is subject to approval by the project.
Native LibreHealth EHR CSS content is organized under the /libraries/
directory.

FONTS directory structure

@package LibreHealthEHR

The /fonts/ directory contains fonts, and only fonts
and sub-directories with font packages that are contiguous,
but are not merely associated assets that can be organized
into the existing directory structure.
Subdirectory content is subject to approval by the project.
